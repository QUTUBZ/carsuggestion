The Car Suggestion App is a Streamlit-based AI-powered recommendation system that helps users find the most suitable car based on their preferences. The application utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest cars by comparing user inputs with an existing dataset of car specifications. Users can refine their search by prioritizing features such as mileage, year, fuel type, and transmission etc  as well as filtering results by specific car brands.

The system standardizes and encodes categorical variables for efficient processing, ensuring accurate recommendations. By leveraging feature scaling, weighted prioritization, and brand-based filtering, the app enhances user decision-making, making it easier to find the best car that meets individual needs. This tool provides a data-driven, user-friendly approach to car selection, making the car-buying experience more streamlined and efficient. ðŸš—âœ¨
